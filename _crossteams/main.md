### Cross-team sessions' goals

Although we are all involved in a NeIC activity or project, we don't always have a good overview of all the NeIC projects. This is even more true as the number
of NeIC projects increase and new staff are hired.
 
The main goal of these cross-team sessions is to learn about each other, share knowledge, find synergies and trigger cross-disciplinary collaboration. 

We split the cross-team sessions in 3 parts:

- Flash talks: present your project with an aim to be understood by a large audience.
- Hands-on: show your skills and how you solved a particular problem in your project.
- Discuss and share: discuss about future prospectives on a chosen topic, write a blog, and present the main outcomes in a 2-3 minutes oral.
presentation during the wrap-up session on Wednesday.


### Flash talk for project overview

In the first part, we wish each project manager to make a very short oral presentation to explain what their project is about and why it is important to 
get NeIC support.

Each project will have no more than 5 minutes to present their work in an engaging and accessible way;  
These flash talks are aimed to be understood by non-specialist audiences but you should try to highlight the challenges met in your project and why 
collaboration within Nordic countries facilitates searching and finding appropriate solutions for these problems.

Some information on how to give a flash talk can be found [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk).
