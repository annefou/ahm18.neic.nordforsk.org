title: Natural language processing of NeIC Slack logs in a Jupyter notebook
---

Have you ever wondered what words and phrases are used the most across all NeIC Slack channels? Or are you curious to know, for example, at which time of the day the average NeIC team member in Denmark posts his/her first message to #random? Or how that compares to Sweden, Finland, Norway or Iceland? Or whether this is at all correlated with the average amount of coffee consumed in these respective countries?
If so, please join us for an interactive, hands-on tutorial filled with data analysis, cool visualizations and possibly even some machine learning. Oh, and we’ll do all work inside a Jupyter Notebook, so some valuable lessons in using this tool are guaranteed. 

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. In order to participate in the workshop, you will need to install Jupyter Notebooks on your laptop (and bring your laptop!). We will use Python for our analysis so previous experience with Python is useful, but not required.
The simplest way to install Python and Jupyter is through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (follow these links for downloads and installation instructions). If you install Anaconda, you are set. If you prefer Miniconda, you will need to install the following packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Using the command 

```
$ conda install <package-name>
```

If you prefer pip, you can create a virtual environment with
```
$ virtualenv -p python2.7 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

followed by 
```
$ pip install <package-name>
```
