### Cross-team sessions' goals


Although we are all involved in a NEIC activity or project, we hardly have a good overview of all the NEIC projects.

The main goal of these cross-team sessions is to learn about each other, find synergies and trigger cross-disciplinary collaboration. 


### Flash talk to overcome communication mismatch

In the first part, we wish each project to make a short presentation to explain what their projet is about and why it is important to get NEIC support.

No more than 5 minutes for each project.

### Learn with hands-on

To learn about each other, we wish each NEIC project to present (in a very practical way i.e. with hands-on) how they solved a particular problem in their project.
For instance:

- show how you can visualize large datasets from your laptop (remote visualization)
- teach us how you deploy containers (docker/signularity) and allow computations close to data 
- present the approach and tools you use to track issues/bugs and test your software before a new release
- show how you check the quality of your data before archiving/publishing
- teach us how you check the performance of your applications


### Speed blogging

Because we would like you share your views on how a specific problem was solved, we would like each team to discuss about what they have learnt and how they
would solve (or have solved) similar problems in their project.

Write a short blog on your findings.
