### Cross-team sessions' goals


Although we are all involved in a NEIC activity or project, we hardly have a good overview of all the NEIC projects.

The main goal of these cross-team sessions is to learn about each other, find synergies and trigger cross-disciplinary collaboration. 

We split the cross-team sessions in 3 parts:

- Flash talks: present your project with an aim to be understood by a large audience
- Hands-on: show your skills and how you solved a particular problem in your project
- Discuss and share: discuss on a topic presented during the previous hands-on session, write a blog and present the main outcomes in a 2-3 minutes oral 
presentation during the wrap-up session on Wednesday.


### Flash talk to overcome communication mismatch

In the first part, we wish each project to make a presentation to explain what is their project about and why it is important to get NEIC support.

Each project will have no more than 5 minutes to present their work in an engaging and accessible way;  
These flash talks are aimed to be understood by non-specialist audiences but you should try to highlight the challenges met in your project and why 
collaboration within Nordic countries facilitates searching and finding appropriate solutions for these problems.

Some information on how to give a flash talk can be found [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk).


### Learn with hands-on

To learn about each other work and skills, we wish each NEIC project to present (in a very practical way i.e. with hands-on) how they solved a particular 
problem in their project.  Each project should offer at least one hands-on but we strongly encourage you to present several topics so we can find synergies 
between projects and better organize team work.


For instance:

- Show how you can visualize large datasets from your laptop (remote visualization)
- Teach us how you deploy containers (docker/signularity) and allow computations close to data 
- Present the approach and tools you use to track issues/bugs (such as Trello) and test your software before a new release
- Show us which version control tool you use and how you use it in your project
- Show us how you organize code review in your project
- Show how you check the quality of your data before archiving/publishing
- Teach us how you check the performance of your applications
- Show us how you use Agile, with Github, Zenhub, and Slack to drive distributed software development.
- Hands-on on how to do use Spotify Rhythm to do agile project prioritization
- Show us how to use Google docs in stakeholder engagement
- Show us how you use Slack for your project
- Show us what you use for data management in your project
...


### Speed blogging

Because we would like you share your views on how a specific problem was solved, we will create teams on the basis on the previous hands-on topics and we 
would like each team to discuss about what they have learnt and how they would solve (or have solved) similar problems in their project.

The following guidance is given to help you for this session:
- Take about 1 hour to discuss about the topic chosen in your team.
- Write a short blog on your findings during the rest of the session: choose one or two pictures and write a few paragraphs
- Keep about 10 minutes before the end of the session to choose who will present your findings during the wrap-up session 
and prepare your 2-3 minutes presentation.
