### Cross-team sessions' goals


Although we are all involved in a NeIC activity or project, we don't always have a good overview of all the NeIC projects. The is even more true as the number
of NEIC projects increase and new staff are hired.
 
The main goal of these cross-team sessions is to learn about each other, share knowledge, find synergies and trigger cross-disciplinary collaboration. 

We split the cross-team sessions in 3 parts:

- Flash talks: present your project with an aim to be understood by a large audience
- Hands-on: show your skills and how you solved a particular problem in your project
- Discuss and share: discuss about future prospectives on a chosen topic, write a blog, and present the main outcomes in a 2-3 minutes oral 
presentation during the wrap-up session on Wednesday.


### Flash talk to overcome communication mismatch

In the first part, we wish each project manager to make a very short oral presentation to explain what is their project about and why it is important to 
get NeIC support.

Each project will have no more than 5 minutes to present their work in an engaging and accessible way;  
These flash talks are aimed to be understood by non-specialist audiences but you should try to highlight the challenges met in your project and why 
collaboration within Nordic countries facilitates searching and finding appropriate solutions for these problems.

Some information on how to give a flash talk can be found [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk).


### Learn with hands-on

We all met successfully a technological or methodological challenge in our project and this session is about sharing our success and knowledge with
other NEIC projects.

Each project has been asked to submit at least one topic for a short hand-on/demo/show me your tool session. All projects have very well responded and thanks to their feedbacks and internal discussions we have now the following topics:

1. How do we use tools for version control and co-editing e.g. Google drive, Wiki, Github?
2. How do we use Slack, TypeForm and Zendesk to organise communication and events?
3. How do we use the next cloud service like data.deic.dk? How can you find and deploy a scientific workflow in the cloud?
4. How do we use machine learning algorithms to improve our data processing?

Do not forget to choose your topic when you register otherwise we would have to randomly assign you to a cross-team!

We will try our best to accommodate your choice but keep in mind that we have to dispatch all of you within these groups to create cross-teams.

### Speed blogging

During this session we are going to discuss and write blogs. Like in the previous session, you have been asked to choose speed-blogging topics 
(by order of preference) at registration time. We have done our best to accommodate your choice but we had to make sure no more we had no more than 5 
persons per topic!

While we discussed and shared our sucess stories in the previous session, here we will discuss future perspectives on:

1. How do you create a NeIC identity (HR policy, competence development, 10% helping time, NeIC culture, branding and visibility, keeping this alive)?
2. How do we best organize documentation? What is the best tool, strategy (inwards & outwards, googleTeam? vendor Lock-In trap)?
3. How can we bootstrap and manage projects in a light way?
4. How do we build a Nordic-wide community of scientific software developers, application experts and other e-science experts? An inspiring
example of how this can work is the community of research software engineers (RSEs) in the UK. What will it take to build a RSE-like community in the Nordics? What are the challenges in
creating a community over Nordic borders? What role can NeIC play in this endeavour?
5. What are the next step to deploy a local European Genome Archive (EGA) development environment for the Nordic countries?
6. Make a movie on the NeIC vision and strategic process!
7. What does the future hold for data mining?


The following guidance is given to help you for this session:
- Take about 1 hour to discuss about the topic chosen in your team.
- Write a short blog on your findings during the rest of the session: choose one or two pictures and write a few paragraphs
- Keep about 10 minutes before the end of the session to choose who will present your findings during the wrap-up session 
and prepare your 2-3 minutes presentation.
