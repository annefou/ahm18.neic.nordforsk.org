        <h3 id="cross-team-sessions-goals">Cross-team sessions’ goals</h3>

<p>Although we are all involved in a NeIC activity or project, we don’t always have a good overview of all the NeIC projects. This is even more true as the number
of NEIC projects increase and new staff are hired.</p>

<p>The main goal of these cross-team sessions is to learn about each other, share knowledge, find synergies and trigger cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>We split the cross-team sessions in 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flash talks: present your project with an aim to be understood by a large audience</li>
  <li>Hands-on: show your skills and how you solved a particular problem in your project</li>
  <li>Discuss and share: discuss about future prospectives on a chosen topic, write a blog, and present the main outcomes in a 2-3 minutes oral 
presentation during the wrap-up session on Wednesday.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flash-talk-for-project-overview">Flash talk for project overview</h3>

<p>In the first part, we wish each project manager to make a very short oral presentation to explain what their project is about and why it is important to 
get NeIC support.</p>

<p>Each project will have no more than 5 minutes to present their work in an engaging and accessible way;<br />
These flash talks are aimed to be understood by non-specialist audiences but you should try to highlight the challenges met in your project and why 
collaboration within Nordic countries facilitates searching and finding appropriate solutions for these problems.</p>

<p>Some information on how to give a flash talk can be found <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="learn-with-hands-on">Learn with hands-on</h3>

<p>We all successfully met a technological or methodological challenge in our project and this session is about sharing our success and knowledge with
other NEIC projects.</p>

<p>Each project has been asked to submit at least one topic for a short hand-on/demo/show me your tools session. All projects have responded and thanks to their feedback and internal discussions we have converged to the following topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do we use tools for version control and co-editing e.g. Google drive, Wiki, Github?</li>
  <li>How do we use Slack, TypeForm and Zendesk to organise communication and events?</li>
  <li>How do we use the next cloud service like data.deic.dk? How can you find and deploy a scientific workflow in the cloud?</li>
  <li>How do we use machine learning algorithms to improve our data processing?</li>
</ol>

<p>Do not forget to choose your topic when you register otherwise we would have to randomly assign you to a cross-team!</p>

<p>We will try our best to accommodate your choice but keep in mind that we have to dispatch all of you within these groups to create cross-teams.</p>

<h3 id="speed-blogging">Speed blogging</h3>

<p>During this session we are going to discuss and write blogs. Like in the previous session, you have been asked to choose speed-blogging topics 
(by order of preference) at registration time. You will be at most 5 people per topic.</p>

<p>While we discussed and shared our sucess stories in the previous session, here we will discuss future perspectives on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do you create a NeIC identity (HR policy, competence development, 10% helping time, NeIC culture, branding and visibility, keeping this alive)?</li>
  <li>How do we best organize documentation? What is the best tool, strategy (inwards &amp; outwards, googleTeam? vendor Lock-In trap)?</li>
  <li>How can we bootstrap and manage projects in a light way?</li>
  <li>How do we build a Nordic-wide community of scientific software developers, application experts and other e-science experts? An inspiring
example of how this can work is the community of research software engineers (RSEs) in the UK. What will it take to build a RSE-like community in the Nordics? What are the challenges in
creating a community over Nordic borders? What role can NeIC play in this endeavour?</li>
  <li>What are the next step to deploy a local European Genome Archive (EGA) development environment for the Nordic countries?</li>
  <li>Make a movie on the NeIC vision and strategic process!</li>
  <li>What does the future hold for data mining?</li>
</ol>

<p>The following guidance is given to help you for this session:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take about 1 hour to discuss about the topic chosen in your team.</li>
  <li>Write a short blog on your findings during the rest of the session: choose one or two pictures and write a few paragraphs</li>
  <li>Keep about 10 minutes before the end of the session to choose who will present your findings during the wrap-up session 
and prepare your 2-3 minutes presentation.</li>
</ul>
