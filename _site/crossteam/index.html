        <h3 id="cross-team-sessions-goals">Cross-team sessions’ goals</h3>

<p>Although we are all involved in a NEIC activity or project, we hardly have a good overview of all the NEIC projects.</p>

<p>The main goal of these cross-team sessions is to learn about each other, find synergies and trigger cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>We split the cross-team sessions in 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flash talks: present your project with an aim to be understood by a large audience</li>
  <li>Hands-on: show your skills and how you solved a particular problem in your project</li>
  <li>Discuss and share: discuss on a topic presented during the previous hands-on session, write a blog and present the main outcomes in a 2-3 minutes oral 
presentation during the wrap-up session on Wednesday.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flash-talk-to-overcome-communication-mismatch">Flash talk to overcome communication mismatch</h3>

<p>In the first part, we wish each project to make a presentation to explain what is their project about and why it is important to get NEIC support.</p>

<p>Each project will have no more than 5 minutes to present their work in an engaging and accessible way;<br />
These flash talks are aimed to be understood by non-specialist audiences but you should try to highlight the challenges met in your project and why 
collaboration within Nordic countries facilitates searching and finding appropriate solutions for these problems.</p>

<p>Some information on how to give a flash talk can be found <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="learn-with-hands-on">Learn with hands-on</h3>

<p>To learn about each other work and skills, we wish each NEIC project to present (in a very practical way i.e. with hands-on) how they solved a particular 
problem in their project.  Each project should offer at least one hands-on but we strongly encourage you to present several topics so we can find synergies 
between projects and better organize team work.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show how you can visualize large datasets from your laptop (remote visualization)</li>
  <li>Teach us how you deploy containers (docker/signularity) and allow computations close to data</li>
  <li>Present the approach and tools you use to track issues/bugs (such as Trello) and test your software before a new release</li>
  <li>Show us which version control tool you use and how you use it in your project</li>
  <li>Show us how you organize code review in your project</li>
  <li>Show how you check the quality of your data before archiving/publishing</li>
  <li>Teach us how you check the performance of your applications</li>
  <li>Show us how you use Agile, with Github, Zenhub, and Slack to drive distributed software development.</li>
  <li>Hands-on on how to do use Spotify Rhythm to do agile project prioritization</li>
  <li>Show us how to use Google docs in stakeholder engagement</li>
  <li>Show us how you use Slack for your project</li>
  <li>Show us what you use for data management in your project
…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="speed-blogging">Speed blogging</h3>

<p>Because we would like you share your views on how a specific problem was solved, we will create teams on the basis on the previous hands-on topics and we 
would like each team to discuss about what they have learnt and how they would solve (or have solved) similar problems in their project.</p>

<p>The following guidance is given to help you for this session:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take about 1 hour to discuss about the topic chosen in your team.</li>
  <li>Write a short blog on your findings during the rest of the session: choose one or two pictures and write a few paragraphs</li>
  <li>Keep about 10 minutes before the end of the session to choose who will present your findings during the wrap-up session 
and prepare your 2-3 minutes presentation.</li>
</ul>
