### Keynote speaker Romain Wartel


This keynote gives an overview of the current computer security landscape. It describes the main vectors of intrusions, and reveal inner mechanisms of the underground economy to expose how our resources are exploited by organised crime groups. By showing how these attacks are both sophisticated and profitable, the presentation concludes that, the only mean to run projects and operate services today, is to build a tight international collaboration, share information and establish trust among the community. This is a valid strategy for many other areas beyond computer security.

#### About Romain Wartel

Romain is responsible for the security of the distributed computing
infrastructure of CERN's main particle accelerator
[http://cern.ch/lcg](http://cern.ch/lcg). This distributed infrastructure is open to over
10 000 scientists from more than a 100 countries to access massively
powerful computing resources as a single global computer, and they
should produce around 50 PB of open scientific data just in 2017.

He focuses mainly on operational security (large scale incident
handling, vulnerability management, threat intelligence, forensics),
including large scale incidents affecting multiple resource providers
and mission critical services, as well as international collaboration
and trust, both between the participants and with the rest of the
Internet security community.
